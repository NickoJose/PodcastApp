Integration Tests

	First integration test is focused on testing each seam in our project. In our case, this will be the interaction between business component and the persistence component. It is composed of a sequence of calls which also includes error and invalid situations.
	Second integration test is focused on testing the external resource. In our case, this will be the interaction between persistence component and the “real” database. It has the same kind of tests as the first integration test.
