# Vision Statement - Podcast App

The **Podcast App Name** will be used to download audio and video files such as podcasts, so users can listen or watch anytime they want. The application will display all the files that were downloaded and display detailed information of each one of them such as upload dates, audio/video lengths, file size, and so on. It will also display all the available episodes of a podcast and radio stations including information about them such as language, genre, and their schedule of uploading.

The target demographic will be all-encompassing as podcasts cater to nearly any interest. The app will save users from the often tedious task of manually seeking out their desired podcasts on the internet by having a centralized repository of podcasts for ease of searching. The app also facilitates the easy creation of playlists, searching of episodes by name or by tag, and sorting by content creator. Users will be able to rate individual episodes, seasons, or channels as a whole. A subscription system will inform users about any new content from any creator theyâ€™ve subscribed to, saving them the need to check on their own time.

The podcast app will improve upon similar applications by focusing on a simple, learnable interface, allowing new users to easily get started. It will also provide desired utilities for more experienced users by customizing the interface to reveal more advanced features.

Accounts will not be forced on users to allow for efficiency for new users. Accounts will be available if users want to post comments to socially engage with other users, create public playlists, and so on. We consider it a design goal to maximize what can be done without an account.

The expected cost of developing this application will be approximately 3 months of time by a team of 5 developers. We will consider this project successful if 25% of people who download the app are still using it a month later. This would demonstrate an ability to compete as a viable alternative to other means of viewing podcasts. Having demonstrated this, we then would be justified in more significant costs, such as legal work and advertising.
