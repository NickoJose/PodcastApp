# Podcast App Vision Statement  

The podcast app will centralize the process of finding, obtaining, posting and listening to podcasts. The app is a podcast streaming and downloading service. The target users for this app are anyone who wants to listen to or produce podcasts. Users will be able to stream podcasts or download them for later. This product would give new podcast creators a platform to host their content.

The application will enable the user to find specific or recommended podcasts. Users will have the option to search through various categories to find podcasts in a desired genre, by top charts or direct search. 

The app will make it easy for a user to download a podcast. The interface will allow the user to manage and listen to podcasts. Users will be able to post their own podcasts using this app. Users will have the ability to create and customize playlists. They can leave reviews and ratings on other userâ€™s playlists and podcasts.

Users will have the ability to listen to podcasts live. They may subscribe to their favorite podcasters and be notified when a stream is about to go live or when a new podcast is posted.

The podcast app will improve upon similar applications by focusing on a learnable interface, allowing new users to easily get started. It will also provide desired utility for experienced users to manage their podcasts.

Accounts will not be forced on users to allow for efficiency for new users. Accounts will be available if users want to post comments, create public playlists, upload podcasts, or subscribe to other users and playlists. Users who do not create an account can still listen to, stream and download playlists. They will have the option to create local playlists.

Users without a connection to the internet will have the ability to share files locally with their friends. They can also listen to other previously downloaded podcasts.

The product could be scaled to handle monetized audio, not necessarily podcasts. Paid services could also be offered to allow users to feature their content.

The application will be considered successful if it obtains at least four stars on the Google Play Store with at least 300 ratings.
