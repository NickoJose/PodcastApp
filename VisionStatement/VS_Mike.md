# Vision Statement - Mike 

## Podcast App

**THE PODCAST APP** is for the on-the-go listener who struggles with spotty internet connections in their daily commute, at work, or even while running errands. Unlike alternatives that always requires internet, **THE PODCAST APP** is a podcast client that doesnâ€™t require internet access after downloading. 

The primary feature of **THE PODCAST APP** will be downloading podcast episodes while on internet connections, listening and watching later when an internet connection is not required. Other features will include having the ability to make and manage playlists and subscriptions, and means of finding new content for users through predictive suggestions and displaying popular choices in general.

Learnability and Usability are design goals that will be important from the beginning. **THE PODCAST APP** will stress minimalist, simplistic design to minimize the bar to entry and minimize the time to mastery of the application.

The expected cost of developing this application will be approximately 3 months of time by a team of 5 developers. We will consider this project successful if 25% of people who download the app are still using it a month later. This would demonstrate an ability to compete as a viable alternative to other means of viewing podcasts.  Having demonstrated this, we then would be justified in more significant costs, such as legal work and advertising.
