January 27, 2018 - Created EpisodeList and ChannelList, these are incomplete and need to be converted to extend ArrayList, not just wrap it. - 1 hour
January 29, 2018 - Created playlist object, needs to be tested - 1 hour
February 7, 2018 - Created Date object, and some tests for it - 1 hour

February 10, 2018 - Fixed all the lists, added tests to ensure the custom functionality works properly. - 3 hours
February 12, 2018 - Create subscription view and episode list view. Thier implementation makes other GUI items crash. Unsure of cause. Not added to master - 4 hours
March 10, 2018 - Restarted subscriptions, channel, and episode list view, starting again from a clean master due to the strange behaviour caused by my last branch. - 3 hours

Also cleaned up some of the GUI to make it look a little cleaner. Removed the hardcoded return buttons because they were creating tons of activities that were never being closed. We can expect the user to use their back buttons (the ones that are baked into the OS) and those do close the activities properly and won't cause a huge list of page returns. - 10 hours
