# Retrospective Activity for Group K #
## Jackson Barker, Nicko Jose, Mike Reimer, Russell Thiessen, Garreth Wiebe ##

	The aspect of our project development that we agreed should be improved is our communication. Throughout iterations 1 and 2, work was divided up, worked on separately, and stitched together – and while this worked well at the beginning with GUI work, it affected productivity where developers had conflicting assumptions about how the project would look, and how pieces would fit together, and even about who was doing which task. 

	To improve our communication, we’ve decided to increase our use of communication channels and lower the threshold-of-importance needed to get feedback or help from other developers. In order to incentivize more communication, and to establish success criteria, we agreed that everyone was required to find two issues to raise with the group during iteration 3 - regardless of whether it’s with review, help fixing code, or with a greater design choice. 

	At the time of writing this document, the communication has improved substantially, and we’ve seen greater involvement in evaluating pull requests as opposed to earlier iterations. The success criteria of two issues per person was noticeably passed, and we therefore consider the retrospective activity successful.
